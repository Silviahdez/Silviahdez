      <h2>Why am I here?</h2>
      <p>
       After studying industrial design engineering and audiovisual communication, I started working in web design and from cascade style sheets, user interface and visual design I ended up in the UX universe.<br><br>It is after my immersion in human centered innovation that I realized what I really love: addressing projects globally, from beginning to end, from the first research to the final launch, taking care of the user's needs at all stages.<br><br>I firmly believe in the ability of design to improve the world around us and make it better. A better design over products and services (physical or virtual ones), makes people's life's easier and I'm very interested in the process of working from a global perspective to the detail orientation; and very often, details are what really make the difference.
